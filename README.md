# BattleMage
 Portfolio/Demo Project

This game will be a 2D chess game which breaks all the rules of chess.  Your wizard, which you will be able to control freely between matches, will help you move the pieces during the game, cast spells to change the rules of the game, and collect your prizes.

A multiplayer system will be added once the game is 100% functional, however the base of the game will involve a variety of levels where you may be assaulting a castle, defending a bridge, or surviving an ambush.  The game will play like chess, however you will not be limited to an 8x8 grid, and can use obstacles to your advantage, or even create obstacles with your spells.  You will have spells that do things like provide temporary invulnerability, create a wall of ice, or mark an allied piece so if it is captured it destroys the enemy piece.

The system has been built with AI and Spells in mind, so is a bit more complex than a typical chess game.  AI has yet to be started, and there are quite a few small things to do on it, such as implement rules for whose turn it currently is, and set up rules for checkmate.  I have put this project temporarily on pause as I have begun a new collaboration, howwever this will resume once I have spare time.

Previous version / Unused Files.
Initially I had a different concept in mind when starting this project(This is where the name Battlemages comes from), and created the chess to test out the multiplayer system I was implementing. Bits remain and haven't quite been cleaned out of the project from this.  I may still use some of the multiplayer system, however my goal has shifted.
