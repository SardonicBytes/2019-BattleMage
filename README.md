# BattleMage
 Portfolio/Demo Project

This game will be a 2D chess game which breaks all the rules of chess.  Your wizard, which you will be able to control freely between matches, will help you move the pieces during the game, cast spells to change the rules of the game, and collect your prizes.

This project has been put on hold.  While the spell system is working, the code lacks some of the archetecture required to do advanced AI.  As such, a new chess based project as begun that builds in these rules in a way a utility AI can effectively predict future movements and plan multiple turns ahead.
